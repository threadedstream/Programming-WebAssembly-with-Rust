# What this repository is about?

Recently, I got interested in WebAssembly, so I wound up searching for materials and 
was very lucky to stumble upon the Kevin Hoffman's book titled "Programming WebAssembly in Rust". This repo doesn't contain all the examples, but it provided me 
with a basic arsenal for fiddling with wasm in future.
